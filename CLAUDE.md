ðŸš€ **Major Implementation Completed:** Transitioned from complex database-based memory system to Claude Code-like file-based memory system.
**Tags:** architecture, file-based, claude-code, implementation

## Key Architecture Changes
ðŸ’¡ **Quick Note:** The memory system now works exactly like Claude Code:
- All memories stored in CLAUDE.md files
- Hierarchical loading: Enterprise > Project > User > Local
- No search required - memories always in context
- @import system for file references
- Immediate availability after adding

## Implementation Details
- FileBasedMemoryManager replaces MemoryManager
- Direct file operations instead of complex database
- Markdown-based storage for human readability
- Token-efficient context generation

## Performance Improvements
âœ… Eliminated search dependencies
âœ… Reduced complexity from 500+ lines to simple file operations
âœ… Guaranteed memory access (no search failures)
âœ… Better Claude Code compatibility

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the new file-based system
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create example CLAUDE.md templates
- [ ] Add file watching for external edits
